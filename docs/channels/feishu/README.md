| verification_token    | string | No       | Token used for Webhook event verification                          |
| allow_from            | array  | No       | Allowlist of user IDs; empty means all users are allowed           |
| random_reaction_emoji | array  | No       | List of random reaction emojis; empty uses the default "Pin"       |

## Setup

1. Go to the [Feishu Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn/) and create an application
2. Enable the **Bot** capability in the application settings
3. Create a version and publish the application (configuration takes effect only after publishing)
4. Obtain the **App ID** (starts with `cli_`) and **App Secret**
5. Fill in the App ID and App Secret in the PicoClaw configuration file
6. Run `picoclaw gateway` to start the service
7. Search for the bot name in Feishu and start a conversation

> PicoClaw connects to Feishu using WebSocket/SDK mode — no public callback address or Webhook URL is required.
>
> `encrypt_key` and `verification_token` are optional; enabling event encryption is recommended for production environments.
>
> For custom emoji references, see: [Feishu Emoji List](https://open.larkoffice.com/document/server-docs/im-v1/message-reaction/emojis-introduce)

## Platform Limitations

> ⚠️ **Feishu channel does not support 32-bit devices.** The Feishu SDK only provides 64-bit builds. Devices running armv6, armv7, mipsle, or other 32-bit architectures cannot use the Feishu channel. For messaging on 32-bit devices, use Telegram, Discord, or OneBot instead.
